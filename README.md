# cacti-sram-10t
Modified version of CACTI supporting 10T SRAM cell modeling and simulation. Includes 10T architecture integration and a change to the 8T cell (sense amplifier replaced with skewed inverter). Enables comparison of 6T, 8T (mod), and 10T designs in terms of delay, energy, and performance.
